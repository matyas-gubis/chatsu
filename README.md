# chatsu
A chat application, where you have to hit the characters like in the game OSU! to send your message.

## How to start the project
To start the project, go to the server folder and run 
```
npm i
```
It will install the node_modules. When it finished, you can run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
This will serve the server as well as the client on http://localhost:3000

## How to play
Open the link http://localhost:3000 in your browser.  
Read the tutorial and hit the Play button.  
On the bottom left corner, enter your name, then write a message in the `message` field.  
Hit enter or click the Send button.
This will start the game, where the letters of your message will appear one-by one.  
Each letter will be surrounded by a shrinking circle.  
When the circle reaches the edge of the letter, hit the appropriate letter on your keyboard.  

Only those letters will be sent as a message, that you could hit correctly.

Enjoy, and have fun :D

## Hackathon
This is a submission to the [Hackathon with Lewis](https://hackathon.lewismenelaws.com/).  
The topic was `Functionally Dysfunctional`, so I came up with this idea, to combine a chat app with the game OSU!
This was my first Hackathon I ever attempted to.

From the 7 available days, I could only spend 8-10 hours to work on this project, so it misses certain features that I wanted to implement.
